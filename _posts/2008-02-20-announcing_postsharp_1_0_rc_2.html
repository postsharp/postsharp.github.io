<p>I am pleased to announce the long awaited second release
candidate of PostSharp 1.0 <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/download/">available for download</a>.</p>



<p>This is a stability release solving all bugs discovered in the
previous release, which has been downloaded over 6 thousand times.</p>
<p>Additionally to <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/tracker/search.php?project_id=1&amp;sticky_issues=off&amp;fixed_in_version=1.0+RC2&amp;sortby=last_updated&amp;dir=DESC&amp;hide_status_id=-2">40 bug fixes</a>, this release brings important changes in licensing and minor
improvement in the installer and packaging.</p>
<h3>Relicensing</h3>
<p>With this release (and from revision 287 exactly), the whole
PostSharp code base has been relicensed from GPL/LGPL/MPL to a GPL 3 / LGPL 3
scheme. Don't be afraid: this relicensing actually affects only a few of you.
<strong>Run-time components are licensed under LGPL, compile-time components
under GPL</strong>. So it is still free to use PostSharp and PostSharp Laos in
your applications, but if you distribute an application that uses PostSharp to
transform assemblies (like an O-R mapper), and don't want to release your work
as open-source, then you are kindly requested to acquire a commercial license. </p>
<p>This licensing scheme is really directed to have
ISV making money on PostSharp contributing to the project.
Commercial licenses will be available to "a selected few" under
a partnership program. </p>
<p>Don't be afraid: I have no plan to "lock"
end-users in GPL licenses.</p>
<p>You will find more about licensing <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/about/license/">on the website</a>. If you
have any question, or if you think you will need a commercial license, do not
hesitate to contact me.</p>
<h3>Improved Distribution Packages</h3>
<p>A minor improvement of the MSI package is that you can now
choose <em>not</em> to install PostSharp in the GAC. PostSharp actually does not
need to be in GAC; I put there to benefit from NGen. If you want to disable GAC
installation and NGeneration, choose the custom installation mode and disable
the option.</p>
<p>Another improvement is that I now provide a package for <em>
xcopy</em> deployment as well as instructions describing how to insert PostSharp
in the MSBuild process at global or project level. </p>
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>I'm sometimes asked for a roadmap with dates...
and when I give some I suddenly get in the incapacity to respect
them! I acknowledge it took me to long to deliver this release.
The reason is that I had to work on another project and I had to
invest the remaining time in the website migration, which became
really urgent. Now that the website is up and that I will have
some time dedicated to the project (I will blog about it soon),
things should go more smoothly. The idea is to deliver a release
candidate every month and to declare the 1.0 branch as stable as
soon as the number of reported bugs become acceptable. It's
difficult to predict how many iterations it will take, but I
still hope to have the stable release for Q2 of this year.</p>
<p>Happy aspecting and keep on good work reporting
bugs!</p>
<p>Gael</p>
