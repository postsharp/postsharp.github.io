Join us on Thursday, January 26th, as our very own <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/company">Igal Tabachnik</a> shows you how to stay DRY (Don’t-Repeat-Yourself) by using aspect-oriented programming (AOP) and <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/">PostSharp</a> to remove boilerplate code that’s duplicated in and across systems.     <br></p>
