<p>The PostSharp Day: first public demonstration of 
   PostSharp. </p>



<p>
<strong>The PostSharp Day
</strong>
   This forth day was for me principally the one of the demonstration of 
   PostSharp. The first real public demonstration. A baptism, to some extend. 
   The strange thing is that PostSharp was first presented to scientists and not 
   to developers while PostSharp was actually developed for developers and not 
   for scientists, and even if I am convinced that it is interesting for 
   scientists, there was a perceptible shift between the talk and its audience. 
   Let me repeat the reasons why PostSharp Core and PostSharp Laos are 
   interesting for researchers:</p>
<p>
1. PostSharp Core is an infrastructure on which assembly transformation 
applications, like code weavers, can be realized very easily. This kind of 
platform, with that level of integration, did not exist before for the .NET 
Framework. Yeah, I did not know that researchers nearly only target Java!</p>
<p>
2. PostSharp Laos is an original and pragmatic aspect weaver. Pragmatic because 
it speaks the same language as the programmer and was designed to have a flat 
learning curve. Original because some features, like compile-time behaviors of 
aspects, are really unique.
</p>
<p><strong>Componentizing Classes
</strong>

   The other talks I remembered from this day are all about different strategies 
   to componentize classes. I have already written about it in yesterday&#39;s post 
   with an approach named traits. So more approaches were presented, but, again, 
   they require language extensions or at least a pre-compilation step. It does 
   not means that it is uninteresting, of course (and this could be implemented 
   by Visual Studio generating partial classes), but it cannot be implemented 
   using PostSharp.

There is a Czech proverb telling that when you have a hammer, everything looks 
like a nail, but here there is even no resemblance...
