<p><img style="margin: 9px 5px 0px 0px; display: inline; float: left" alt="" align="left" src="http://www.enjoyart.com/library/vintagewoodsignart/vintagesurfartsigns/large/0002-6985-Vintage-Endless-Summer-Surf-Wo.jpg" width="221" height="221" /></p>  <p>Our never-ending mission to spread the word about using PostSharp to produce cleaner code finds Gael and I in the good ole U.S. of A. for a week of presentations at user groups and businesses in Ohio and Michigan.</p>  <p><a href="http://twitter.com/joekunk">Joe Kunk</a> first contacted us about the idea earlier this year and, together with the undying help of <a href="http://twitter.com/davidgiard">David Giard</a>, we were able to build a tour that combines 4 user groups, 3 businesses, and 1 university over a 5 day stretch of interstate travel.</p>  <p>We sprinkled-in some customer visits for good measure, and added an extended layover at TechEd Europe on the way back to Prague and voilà: the perfect summer tour.</p>  <p>Gael has two presentations prepared for the tour:</p>  <ul>   <li>“<em>Multithreading Beyond the Lock Keyword.</em>” Dusting-off low-level synchronization primitives, Gael shows how to design programs that make better use of multiple cores. Because playing directly with low-level primitives can be overly complex, you’ll discover how large-scale multi-core software can be simplified using design patterns and how some these patterns can be ultimately simplified using aspect-oriented programming. </li>    <li>“<em>Intro to Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) with PostSharp.”</em> Gael speaks about the problem with conventional programming, gives a gentle introduction to AOP with PostSharp, demonstrates how it works and why you should use it to eliminate scattered, tangled and coupled code from your codebases. </li> </ul>  <p>We’re excited to connect with user group leaders, members, and area businesses in Cleveland, Toledo, Detroit and Lansing. We look forward to learning about your current projects, the insight you provide about the solutions you’re looking for, and any feedback you can give about how you’re using PostSharp and our new toolkits.</p>  <p>Tour dates and locations include:</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <table style="width: 338px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tbody>     <tr>       <td valign="top" width="95">JUNE 18</td>        <td valign="top" width="241"><a href="http://www.clevelandwpf.info/">Cleveland WPF User Group</a></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="95">JUNE 19</td>        <td valign="top" width="241"><a href="http://www.oakland.edu/secs/cse">Oakland University</a></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="95">&#160;</td>        <td valign="top" width="241"><a href="http://nwnug.com/graffiti/">NWNUG</a></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="95">JUNE 20</td>        <td valign="top" width="241"><a href="http://www.dominos.com/">Domino’s Pizza HQ</a></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="95">&#160;</td>        <td valign="top" width="241"><a href="http://www.migang.org/Home.aspx">Great Lakes Area .NET Users Group</a></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="95">JUNE 21</td>        <td valign="top" width="241"><a href="http://new.mha.org/mha/index.htm">Michigan Health &amp; Hospital Assoc.</a></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="95">&#160;</td>        <td valign="top" width="241"><a href="http://www.consumersenergy.com/">Consumers Energy</a></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="95">&#160;</td>        <td valign="top" width="241"><a href="http://www.glugnet.org/">Greater Lansing .NET User Group</a></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="95">JUNE 22</td>        <td valign="top" width="241"><a href="http://us.sogeti.com/">Sogeti</a></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="95">JUNE 26 &amp; 27</td>        <td valign="top" width="241"><a href="http://europe.msteched.com/">TechEd Europe 2012</a></td>     </tr>   </tbody></table>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>TechEd Europe promises to be one of the summer highlights, connecting us with new and old friends alike.
