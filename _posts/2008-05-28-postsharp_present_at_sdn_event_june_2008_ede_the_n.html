<p>I will present aspect-oriented programming and PostSharp at the
<a href="http://www.sdn.nl/Default.aspx?tabid=304">Software Development
Event</a> (SDE) in Ede, The Netherlands, on June 23th, 2008.</p>
<p>I have two sessions of 75 minutes each:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Addressing non-functional
requirements with aspects</strong>: a general
introduction to aspect-oriented programming
(AOP) with a presentation of typical problems
of software engineering that can be better
solved using AOP and an outlook at different
popular AOP solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Towards more complex aspects using
PostSharp</strong>: a thorough trip into
PostSharp Laos showing how to concretely
develop more complex aspects and apply them to
business applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although my talks have been placed into the
Visual Basic track, it is actually not specific to
VB at all, and all samples will even be in C#. </p>
<p>I will be there till Tuesday, so if anyone there
wants to meet me (in Eve or Amsterdam), there is
an opportunity. Just let it know!
</p><p>Happy PostSharping!</p>

<p>Gael</p>
