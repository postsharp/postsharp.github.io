<p>Just a quick note to announce that PostSharp 3.0.30 now supports both Visual Studio 2013 and .NET 4.5.1. You can install PostSharp from the Extensions and Updates tool of Visual Studio 2013, or simply download it from <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/download">http://www.postsharp.net/download</a>.</p>

  <p>Doing so, we are delivering on our promise to bring quick support for new platforms independently from our versioning policy. We learned from our previous failure to deliver support for Visual Studio 2012 on time. The reason? the feature was bound to the delayed PostSharp 3. Now, after our switch from a per-version to a per-year maintenance model, we are happy to make this feature to everyone with a valid maintenance subscription. Our license prices now include a mandatory one-year maintenance subscription, which means that everybody who paid for PostSharp 3 got support for Visual Studio 2013 for free.</p>  <p>Happy PostSharping!</p>  <p>-gael</p>
