 <p>I&#39;m finally back from the AOSD 2008 conference, the principal conference 
 of the Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD) community. This is an 
 academic conference, which means that most people are either academic 
 researchers, either researchers in R&amp;D departments of big companies. So I 
 was a kind of stranger there, but this time I did not suffer too much from 
 that.</p>
 <p>I have delivered my speech on Wednesday 2nd April in the industry track. 
 Slides are available for
 <a href="http://download.postsharp.org/slides/AOSD%202008%20-%20PostSharp.pptx">
 download</a>. Note that the speech was designed for an audience who is 
 comfortable with AspectJ, which I guess is not the case of the majority of 
 readers of this blog. You can also
 <a href="http://download.postsharp.org/slides/PostSharp-AOSD2008.pdf">
 download the paper</a>, the most systematic and complete description of 
 PostSharp Laos so far. It was published in the proceedings of the 
 conference. If you need to convince someone that PostSharp is serious, you 
 can put the paper on his table!</p>
 <p>The conference was not only about PostSharp, of course. I mostly attended 
 to the industry track and to some demonstrations. Here are the topics I was 
 most interested in:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Daniel Wiese, Software Architect at Siemens Medical Solutions, 
  presented how AOP was used in a huge project (SORIAN, a Hospital 
  Information System) of 400 developers spread in 4 different countries. 
  AOP was used principally to handle the &quot;non-functionals&quot;, i.e. logging, 
  auditing and so on. What&#39;s interesting with that? Well, the scale of 
  course! It shows that AOP has already grown from its youth phase when it 
  was used only in prototypes. Daniel cited some practical problems they 
  met with AOP, principally the increased build time. The selected 
  solution was to weave the code only for nightly builds, so developers do 
  not loose time waiting for the weaver in local builds. Siemens also 
  wanted to enable/disable aspects after deployment (for instance to 
  enable monitoring in a part of the solution when it is in production). 
  Therefore, they used load-time weaving in WebSphere, a Java application 
  server. Since the built-in weaving solution of WebSphere was not 
  satisfying (it was an old version of AspectJ with bad support of 
  load-time weaving), they developed their own weaver:
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fastaop">FastAOP</a>. Thank you 
  Daniel for this great show, and let&#39;s hope it will convince companies to 
  adopt this technology!</li>
  <li>SAP integrated AOP technologies in the new version of ABAP, the SQP 
  programming language. True, it is not AOP in the sense we usually mean, 
  but if SAP is getting interested in AOP, what are all the others waiting 
  for? Another proof that it&#39;s useful!</li>
  <li>ASLM, a producer of semiconductors, developed their own solution to 
  weave hundreds of thousands of lines of code in C.</li>
  <li>Hitachi developed an AO extension to COBOL. Yes, you read well: the 
  old good COBOL.</li>
  <li>Siemens team presented a funny show of Aspect Manager 2010, a 
  plug-in to Eclipse allowing easy discovery of aspects and their 
  injection into projects. An excellent source of inspiration for 
  PostSharp! Indeed, it convinced me that we should design a standard 
  packaging for aspect libraries to streamline the installation process.</li>
  <li>
  <a href="http://www.dawis.wiwi.uni-due.de/forschung/foci/aosd/jpdds/">
  M4JPDD</a>, a tool to express quite graphically complex pointcut. Very 
  interesting, although IMHO not backed by a sufficient demand.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The conclusion for me is that there is real interest for AOP in industry, 
 and AOP has already proved itself in huge projects. Why would the .NET world 
 make exception? Experience shows that people are currently mostly interested 
 in the &quot;easy&quot; aspects like caching, auditing, security, and so on. But it is 
 precisely what PostSharp Laos is good in! So it seems I am on the good 
 track. On the other side, there is a lot more in AOP than what PostSharp is 
 able to do! If you follow the blog and the work of
 <a href="http://www.sitechno.com/Blog/">Ruurd Boeke</a>, you will find out 
 that PostSharp does not perform well with complex tasks. Of course, you can 
 do everything you want (which gives an amazing feeling), but it results in 
 much more aspect code than what would be the case with AspectJ.</p>
 <p>In other words, the conference was a great opportunity to assess the 
 design choice of PostSharp Laos: make simple things easy, knowing that the 
 market is currently at 80% interested in easy things.</p>
 <p>Happy PostSharping!</p>
