<p>As most of you know, PostSharp’s transformation (weaving) of aspects into your assemblies happens after the compilation. One of the most requested features is the ability to see the actual code that is produced by PostSharp. Until now, you had to manually open the newly compiled assembly in your favorite decompiler to see the produced code.</p>  <p>We are delighted to announce that we’ve made viewing the source code in your favorite decompiler much easier – via a single click on the enhanced class or method:</p>  <p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="" border="0" alt="" src="/blog/image.axd?picture=6c44ed6f40b27715.png" width="644" height="434" /></p>  <p>By clicking the <strong>See enhanced source code</strong> link for the first time, you will be asked to select the decompiler you want to use (we currently support <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/">dotPeek</a>, <a href="http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/ILSpy.ashx">ILSpy</a> and <a href="http://www.reflector.net/">Reflector</a>). You can always change the decompiler later from <strong>Tools – Options – PostSharp</strong>:</p>  <p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="" border="0" alt="" src="/blog/image.axd?picture=19ce2c8f1e0157fb.png" width="644" height="376" /></p>  <p>From now on, when you click on the <strong>See enhanced source code</strong>, your chosen decompiler will open and show you exactly the source code, as it was modified by PostSharp!</p>  <p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="" border="0" alt="" src="/blog/image.axd?picture=2790987926438552.png" width="644" height="351" /></p>  <p>This feature is available in the <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/downloads/postsharp-2.1/hot-fixes/v2.1.5.8-1748">latest version of PostSharp</a>!</p>  <p>Happy PostSharping!</p>  <p>-Igal</p>
