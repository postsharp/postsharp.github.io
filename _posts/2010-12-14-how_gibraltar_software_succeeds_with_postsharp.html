  <p>As Principal at <a href="http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com">Gibraltar Software</a> his day is filled with them. So imagine our surprise when, over drinks in London earlier this month, he told us how he recently turned the tables on a doubting customer with a challenge of his own:</p>  <p>“Give us 15 minutes to prove our value.”</p>  <p>The statement was so bold we just had to take out our recording equipment and get it on video. Watch to find out how Gibraltar turned the customer into a true believer, with the help of PostSharp, in under 15 minutes.</p> <object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LB2KuGv4_ew?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/LB2KuGv4_ew?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></object>  <p>Do you have your own stories of exceeding customer expectations?
