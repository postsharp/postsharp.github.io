<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Thank you so much</span> to all of you who have answered the survey. You have been 144 to give very valuable feedback. This is just &nbsp;unexpected and very encouraging.</p>

  <p>The results of the survey are very positive! </p>  <ul class="unIndentedList"><li><strong>PostSharp is used by professionals</strong> in companies of all sizes, all over the world. Even very big ones!</li><li><strong>PostSharp is used in production</strong> <strong>software</strong> by at least 30% of users. I think it is more, since survey invitations were skewed in favor of recent users (because users were not required to register before the beginning of January).</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">98% </span>of users consider that using PostSharp results in <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">fewer lines of code</span> and code of<span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> higher quality</span>.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">90%</span> of users consider that <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">PostSharp is stable</span></li></ul>        <p>Maybe the worse score is community visibility: only 61% of respondents considered that the project is well visible... to which I want to answer: go on, blog about it, talk about it in your UG, invite me if you can! The web site gets 86% of satisfaction with some negative remarks, mainly due to the problems we got with the recent launch of the new Joomla+phpbb system.</p>  <p>Another point requiring improvements is documentation: 77% consider that PostSharp is well documented, but 84% wishes better documentation. The most important feature for next versions is <strong>better run-time performance</strong> and <strong>library of ready-to-use aspects</strong>.</p>  <p>And finally, 70% of respondents declare themselves likely to buy a commercial version. Encouraging - although there can be of course a distance between intentions and acts!</p>  <p>But better read yourself:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.postsharp.org/all-downloads/documents/postsharp-community-survey-2009.pdf/download"><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Download PostSharp Community Survey 2009 Report</span></a> (PDF)</p><p>Happy PostSharping!</p><p>-gael&nbsp;</p>
