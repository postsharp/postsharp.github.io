<p>I am please to announce that <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/contributions/instrumentation/log4postsharp">Log4PostSharp</a>, one of the favorite plug-ins to PostSharp, has been ported to PostSharp 1.5 by Mark Kharitonov. The&nbsp;initial version, targetting PostSharp 1.0, has originally been contributed by Michal Dabrowski.</p>

<p>Log4PostSharp implements tracing aspects for the popular framework <strong>log4net</strong>. But unlike what you could achieve easily using PostSharp Laos, Log4PostSharp injects optimal instructions with minimal overhead. You could difficulty write better code by hand.</p><p>Thank you, Mark! I am sure this project is very usefull to the community.</p><p>Happy Log4PostSharping!</p><p>-gael</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
