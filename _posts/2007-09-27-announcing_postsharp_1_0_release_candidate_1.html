<p>I am pleased to announce the first release candidate of PostSharp 1.0. This release solves all problems that have been reported by the community so far.
</p>


<p>The project has taken a great momentum this summer, with the Beta 3 release being downloaded more than 1000 times in just one month. Thank you to for your support and the time you spend in testing and reporting issues.
</p><p>For this release, I would like to address special thanks to <a href="http://www.omicron.at/"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline;color:blue;">Omicron</span></a>, whose important donation allowed me to take the time to maintain the project.
</p><p>It's also a great time to announce that the feature proposals are again open, but this time for the version 1.1. Only small bug fixes will be allowed to be merged in version 1.0.
</p><p>I am often asked when the first stable release will be delivered. My vision is now to publish a new RC every month, and to promote to 'stable' the status of the RC for which no significant bug would have been reported.
</p><p>It's really time now to start using PostSharp in bigger projects. Don't be afraid! First, you won't be the first. Secondly, you will be supported -- and will get a solution within one week.
</p><p>Go PostSharp!
</p>
