<p><a href="http://www.postsharp.net/blog/post/PostSharp-Supports-Prague-Flood-Relief.aspx">On June 3rd</a>, we announced that we would support those affected by the floods and pledged to donate to a local flood relief fund 50% of all online purchases completed during the state of emergency.</p>  <p>On June 7th, as floods started to subside, we sent $2,000 to Caritas, a well-known charity association.</p>  <div><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="/blog/image.axd?picture=11d6e8e4435fb8f0.jpg" /><img style="margin-left: 20px; float: left;" alt="" src="/blog/image.axd?picture=4e16ee58252e2b35.jpg" /></div>  <div class="clear"></div>  <p id="quote"><em>“It is extremely important that we all band together and support one another during such difficult time. We sincerely appreciate the generosity and community spirit of all donors. Your generous help will enable us to support families affected by the flood in Kralupy and its surroundings</em>,” says Barbora Kovarova, director of the local Caritas of Kralupy nad Vltavou.</p>  <p>For the whole team at PostSharp Technologies, I would like to express our warmest thanks to all customers who contributed to the donation.</p>  <p>-iveta</p>
