<p>Mark your calendar for Thursdays in May as we kickoff a new series of live webinars with our good friend, <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/community/profile?id=a7bab0bc-a071-df11-b4ed-000ae4881457-4187c618">Matthew Groves</a>. </p>


 <p>Matt is a developer with over 10 years of professional experience in education, consulting, and product development. He concentrates on web applications, using C# with ASP.NET, JavaScript, and PHP. </p> <p>His new book <a href="http://www.manning.com/groves/">Aspect Oriented Programming in .NET</a> from Manning Publications debuts in June and we’ve put together a 5-part webinar series that will give you a taste of the practical aspect-oriented programming insights found in his book and a variety of real-world coding examples as implemented by PostSharp. </p> <p>Read on to learn more about the upcoming schedule and a special offer from Manning Publications. </p> <p><br><a href="https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/189817950">Sign-up for the PostSharp live webinar series today &gt;&gt;</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>SCHEDULE:</p> <p><strong>1) You May Already Be Using AOP</strong><strong> <br></strong>Thursday, May 2nd at 9:00 AM PDT |12:00 PM EDT | 4:00 PM GMT</p> <p>Learn the basics of Aspect-Oriented Programming and see live coding examples of AOP frameworks that come with ASP.NET. We will also look at how to write a simple PostSharp aspect using a pattern that is similar to the ASP.NET framework. </p> <p><strong>2) Call This Instead: Intercepting Methods <br></strong>Thursday, May 9th at 9:00 AM PDT |12:00 PM EDT | 4:00 PM GMT</p> <p>One of the most common types of aspect is the method interception aspect, which runs a piece of code instead of the intended method. In this episode, we will look at a real-world application of the method interception aspect that can help with data transactions. </p> <p><strong>3) Before and After: Boundary Aspects <br></strong>Thursday, May 16th at 9:00 AM PDT| 12:00 PM EDT | 4:00 PM GMT</p> <p>A PostSharp method boundary aspect can execute code at its borders (e.g. before a method, after a method, on exception). In this episode, we will look at a real-world application of a method boundary aspect to help with caching. </p> <p><strong>4) Under the Hood of a Post-Compiler <br></strong>Thursday, May 23rd at 9:00 AM PDT| 12:00 PM EDT | 4:00 PM GMT</p> <p>The details of how a post-compiler like PostSharp works can be complex, but it's important to have a basic understanding of what's happening in order to make an informed decision about where and when to use it. In this episode, we will look at how to decompile a .NET assembly and view code with/without a PostSharp aspect with ILSpy. </p> <p><strong>5) Unit Testing and Thin Aspects <br></strong>Thursday, May 30th at 9:00 AM PDT| 12:00 PM EDT | 4:00 PM GMT</p> <p>The benefits of unit testing are numerous. When aspects are involved, keeping those aspects "thin" is a key to keeping your code easy to unit test. In the final episode we will explore some of the implications of unit testing when a post-compiler tool is involved. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>SPECIAL OFFER:</p> <p>Now there's even more reason to attend Matt's webinar series. The generous folks at Manning Publications are offering a <strong>big discount</strong> on AOP in .NET to all live webinar attendees. Seats are limited and this series is sure to sell out so reserve your spot today.</p> <p>If you want to learn what difference AOP and PostSharp can make in your projects, and take advantage of Manning’s special discount offer, join us every Thursday throughout the month of May.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/189817950">Reserve your seat for the PostSharp live webinar series now &gt;&gt;</a></p>
