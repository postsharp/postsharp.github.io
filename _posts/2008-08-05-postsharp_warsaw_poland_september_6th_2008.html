<p>Next month I'm back in Poland, this time in Warsaw. I'll be present at the <a href="http://zine.net.pl/blogs/zineday/archive/2008/08/05/zine-day-2008-paczka-news-w.aspx">Zine Day 2008</a>. Once again, I will be in excellent company with Andr&#225;s Belokosztolszki, principal architect of RedGate.</p>  <p>I have two sessions. The first will introduce aspect-oriented programming in general and will compare four frameworks: PostSharp (of course), Spring.NET, Castle, and Microsoft PIAB. This is a tough session, but I have a good time slot (9h-10h15). The second session will be very interactive. Together with Jakub Binkowski, I will demonstrate simple and advanced features of PostSharp Laos on a real application.</p>  <p>See you there!</p>  <p>-Gael</p>
