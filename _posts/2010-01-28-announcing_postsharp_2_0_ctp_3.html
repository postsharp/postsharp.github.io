<p>I am happy to announce the release of PostSharp 2.0 CTP 3, available for <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/all-downloads/postsharp-2.0">download</a> today.</p>


<p>This is principally a bug fixing release, since more than 40 issues have been solved. The most significant improvement is the <strong>Customer Experience Improvement Program</strong> (CEIP): the feature, fully opt-in, is able to automatically report unhandled exceptions in PostSharp, and collects some anonymous usage statistics. The CEIP has been included in an intermediate build between CTP 2 and CTP 3, and most issues solved in CTP have actually been reported by the CEIP. For uploading, our implementation uses <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa362708(VS.85).aspx">Microsoft BITS</a>, a background installed with Windows, so the process never interupts your work and does not consume the bandwidth when you're using it (and it very scalable on our server ;).</p><p>Except that, sadly enough, there has been no progress in features. We have been fully busy preparing the launch of the new company and the new web site. I'm glad to say that, although we are a couple of weeks late on the technical point, we made good progress with commercial stuff. You'll hear more about that in a couple of weeks.</p><p>Just as in CTP 2, the following features are <em>not included in CTP 3 </em>but are planned for a future preview of 2.0:</p><ul><li>Conceptual Documentation; </li><li>Reference Documentation and Conceptual Documentation of PostSharp SDK (previously PostSharp Core); </li><li>Support for Silverlight and Compact Framework. </li></ul><p><strong>This release is hardcoded to expire on March 1st, 2010</strong>, and in the mean time there will be a new release.</p><p>Happy PostSharping!</p><p>-gael</p>
