<p>PostSharp 2.0 CTP1 it out! You can
<a href="http://www.postsharp.org/all-downloads/postsharp-2.0">download it</a> 
today. </p>
<!-- readmore -->

<p>As you understood from my previous posts, PostSharp 2.0 is no disguised minor 
upgrade. PostSharp 2.0 brings major innovations not only to the .NET community, 
but also to the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) community in general.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/blog/postsharp-20-design-objectives">design objective</a> of PostSharp 2.0 is to 
provide a powerful, robust and supportable platform for build-time 
aspect-oriented programming for the next 5 years, with high focus on 
extensibility and well-definedness; PostSharp 2.0 is explicitely designed to 
support multiple vendors of aspects so that ISVs can confidently distribute 
aspects to their customers.</p>
<p>The principal new features of PostSharp 2.0 are the following:</p>


<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.postsharp.org/blog/introducing-postsharp-20-1-notifypropertychanged">
Brand new aspect framework with support for advices (formerly named handlers)</a>, putting PostSharp
on the level of leading aspect frameworks in other programming communities.</li><li>
<a href="http://www.postsharp.org/blog/introducing-postsharp-20-2-amazing-runtime-performance-enhancements">
Amazing Runtime Performance 
Enhancements</a> thanks to Adaptive Code Generation: you don't pay any more for features you don't use.
</li>
<li>

<a href="http://www.postsharp.org/blog/introducing-postsharp-20-3-aspect-dependencies">
A Robust Aspect Dependencies Framework</a> ensuring 
that multiple aspects behave in a predictive and 
consistent way when applied on the same code 
element.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.postsharp.org/blog/introducing-postsharp-20-4-visual-studio-add-in">
A Visual 
Studio Add-In</a> enhancing developers' productivity by answering graphically to two questions: 
to which code elements is my aspect applied, and which aspects are 
applied to my code element.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.postsharp.org/blog/introducing-postsharp-20-5-build-performance-and-packaging">
Improved Packaging and Start-Up Process</a> acheiving higher 
performance, better reliability of the assembly search algorithm, 
and better supportability through extensive logging and support for
<a href="http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com/">Gibraltar</a> (you can 
download <a href="http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com/Try/Default.aspx">
their evaluation version</a> if you want to have the same support 
experience than we have when you&#39;ll send us support details -- just 
start Gibraltar Analyst).</li>
</ul>

<p>That was for the hype.</p>
<p>Now, frankly. Put your expectations inline with this fact that it is the 
first CTP. The objective of an early CTP is to deliver all risky features and 
see if it works. Sure, we have hundreds of unit tests, and it works for us. But 
there is a huge varierty of deployment conditions and source code structure in 
the field, and it&#39;s something we&#39;ll never be able to fully reproduce in a lab.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s Not There?</h2>
<p>This is maybe as important as what&#39;s there. The following features are not in 
the first preview but <em>they will be there in a future preview</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual documentation has not been updated. Class reference has been. 
Please refer to the blog (links given above) for introduction.</li>
<li>PostSharp SDK (PostSharp Core) is not a part of the release and is not 
documented. Please do not use PostSharp Sdk with this CTP since next 
previews will probably break your code.</li>
<li>.NET 4.0 is not yet supported. Sorry for that. I know many of you are 
looking forward for it. It&#39;ll be in next preview.</li>
<li>Support for Compact Framework and Silverlight is not shipped with this 
release. It will be enabled back in a future preview, and newer versions of 
the platform will be supported.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When Will It Be Commercially Available?</h2>
<p>Not before december; probably later.</p>
<p>Lenka, Jirka and others are working hard to deliver a brand new website. 
Attorneys are at work to deliver license texts. And PostSharp 2.0 is far from a 
release candidate anyway.</p>
<p>So please be patient and contact me for any commercial question.</p>
<h2>So What&#39;s Now?</h2>
<p>Remember
<a href="http://www.postsharp.org/blog/postsharp-20-design-objectives">what I 
wrote</a> when I gave the first indications about PostSharp 2.0:</p>
<blockquote>
You know how communication is like: people will blog about it, say it&#39;s 
great (it is), and so on. I will do the same because I need to sell. But 
don&#39;t forget we are first engineers and not marketers.

I want you to break the product. Find flaws. Find the weak element. Where 
will the design break, when it will break? Compare the features to your 
cases. Is there a case we could solve with a small design modification? We 
will maybe not solve your use case in this release, but make sure the design 
allows us to address the case in a future release. Nobody else than you, 
knowledgeable of your particular business, can provide this feedback.</blockquote>
<p>So download PostSharp 2.0 CTP1 and put it on the test bench. Discuss issues 
on the forum and report bugs. You did a great job with PostSharp 1.0. Together, 
we&#39;ll PostSharp 2.0 still better!</p>
<p>Happy PostSharping!</p>
