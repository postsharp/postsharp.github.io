The talk will start with a general introduction to
AOP, then go to specific solutions using
PostSharp.</span></span></p>
<p>It is be a honor for me to stand besides a
great speaker (and professional evangelist)

If anyone of the Pole .NET community wants have
some more in-depth discussion or just have a
beer, I will be there till Sunday evening.</p>
<p>Happy PostSharping!</p>
