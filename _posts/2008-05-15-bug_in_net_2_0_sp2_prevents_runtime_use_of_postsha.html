I have just reported a <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=344051">bug</a> to Microsoft Connect related to .NET 2.0 SP2 Beta, installed with .NET 3.5 SP 1 Beta, itself installed with VS 2008 SP1 Beta.

The bug causes programs transformed by PostSharp to crash. It happens with OnFieldAccessAspect on static fields.

You have been warned!
