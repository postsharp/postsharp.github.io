<p>Szymon Pobiega has just released <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MicroContainer">Micro Container Framework</a>, a dependency injection framework targeting the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mschwarz/archive/2008/07/28/microsoft-net-micro-framework-3-0-beta-open.aspx">.NET Micro Framework 3.0</a>.</p>

 <p>What does it have in common with PostSharp? Easy! Since this platform typically runs with very limited resource, performance is of paramount importance. There is definitively no time to resolve dependencies at runtime, and there is anyway no support for dynamic compilation.</p> <p>The solution? Resolve dependencies at compile-time and inject them... using PostSharp! There is not even use of System.Reflection at runtime!</p> <p>Check this out on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MicroContainer">CodePlex</a>.</p> <p>Congratulations Szymon and thank you for this great work!</p> <p>-gael</p>
