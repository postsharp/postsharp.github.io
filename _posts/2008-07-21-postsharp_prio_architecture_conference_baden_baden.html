<p>I am delighted to announce that I will present PostSharp (officially, aspect-oriented programming and design by contract) in Baden-Baden, Germany, on November 11, 2008 at the <a href="http://www.prioconference.de/home.html">prio.conference 2008 Home Page</a>, dedicated to software architecture.</p>

  <p>Germany is already the country where PostSharp is arguably the most popular, certainly because of the influence of the early enthusiast <a href="http://www.ralfw.de/default.html">Ralf Westphal</a>.</p>  <p>Why design by contract, you may ask? Well, you'll discover it soon on this blog...</p>
