<p>As the first stable version of PostSharp has been released for one month, a question arose: </p>
<!--readmore-->
 <blockquote> <p>What feature or bug fix is important to you, community? In other words, where should we put our effort?</p></blockquote> <p>Finally I've set up a <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/support/vote/">feature voting system</a>: you can vote for a bug or a feature, therefore giving it higher priority. The system is based on 'coins'. Once you create an account on <a href="http://www.postsharp.org">www.postsharp.org</a>, you get 10 coins (existing accounts have been credited of 10 coins as well). You can attribute them to the features of your choice. So you can already <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/support/vote/">start voting</a> immediately!</p> <p>If you <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/donate/">donate</a> to the project, you receive an additional coin for each euro you gave. It does not mean that 1 coin has a value of 1 euro, because I also attribute donations to past efforts and to operational expenses of the project. So to give you an idea, even if coins are not real money, I consider that 1 hour of development should be covered by 100 coins. (Indeed, maintaining and developing PostSharp costs me thousands of euros per month...)</p> <p>After you make a donation using PostSharp, you will receive an email with a link to a page allowing you to connect the coins. This page requires you to be logged in, so your donation will be assigned to your account.</p> <p>There is no trick. Coins are not contractual; they are just a way for you to tell me what is important to you, and for me to tell you that the lunch is not free for everyone.</p> <p>That being said, if you want to make a more significant donation (say &gt;1000 EUR), we can negotiate something contractual, i.e. we discuss what feature will be realized and when. If you are interested by this option, please <a href="http://gael.fraiteur.net/contact/">contact me</a>. For even bigger sponsors, I will set up a partnership program, so you could get the nice status of "PostSharp Silver Partner". Wow!</p> <p>Anyway. Even if you are not to donate, you are already welcome to <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/support/vote/">vote for features</a> now!</p> <p>Happy PostSharping!</p> <p>-gael</p>
