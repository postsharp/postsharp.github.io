<p>I am pleased to announce the availability of <a href="/download">PostSharp 1.5 RC1</a>. This is <strong>a true feature-complete release candidate</strong>; it meets the quality standards of a real release.</p><h3>Upgrade from 1.0 Recommended?</h3><p>If your project is still in development phase, and will be for the next 2 months, I recommend making the upgrade from 1.0 to 1.5 now. The 1.5 branch has to many respects a higher quality level than the 1.0 branch. The last CTP proved to be pretty stable and only little important bugs were reported. See the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/r6a5c4">list of addressed issues</a> for details.</p><h3>Aspects on Serializable Objects</h3><p>Besides bug fixes, this version brings a new extension point (<a href="http://doc.postsharp.org/1.5/ClassRef/html/a7a0ca43-6cd0-7ce2-3f23-d7310ce4c769.htm">ILaosAwareness</a>) that enable you to make PostSharp Laos aware of other frameworks. Indeed, it was known that PostSharp Laos used to work badly on <strong>deserialized objects </strong>because the deserializer does not use the standard constructor. This constraint now belongs to the past: <strong>you can now use all aspects on DataContract or Serializable classes</strong>. </p><p>Thanks to this new feature, you can now apply aspects to serializable classes. You need to download and compile the add-in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/postsharp-user-plugins/wiki/Awareness">PostSharp.Awareness</a>, which makes PostSharp Laos &quot;aware&quot; of DataContractSerializer and BinaryFormatter. If you have a custom serialization framework, you can make PostSharp Laos aware of it by developing a similar plug-in for your framework. These features (the new extension point and the WCF/BinaryFormatter awareness) were sponsored by a large insurance company. Thanks to them!</p><h3>Roadmap</h3><p>The roadmap of the 1.5 branch is clear: wait for reported bugs during 1 month, correct them, and if none of them required non-trivial changes, publish the stable release (otherwise publish a new RC).</p><p>Happy PostSharping!</p><p>-gael</p>
