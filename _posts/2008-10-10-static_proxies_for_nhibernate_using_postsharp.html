<p><a href="http://ayende.com/">Ayende Rayen</a> has just <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/10/10/nhibernate-amp-static-proxies.aspx">implemented 'static proxies' for NHibernate using PostSharp</a>. </p>
<!-- readmore -->
 <p>NHibernate is a well-known O-R mapper. One of the features, lazy loading of properties, previously required you to make all properties virtual. The reason is that the properties were "enhanced" (understand: subclassed) at runtime using AOPish techniques. With PostSharp, Ayende now enables lazy loading even.</p> <p>Ayende did the job in 4 hours:</p> <blockquote> <p>The first thing that I have to say is <em>wow</em> Post Sharp rocks! And I mean that as someone who is doing AOP for a long while, and has implemented some not insignificant parts of Castle.DynamicProxy. Leaving aside the amount of power that it gives you, <a href="http://postsharp.org/">PostSharp</a> <em>simplicity </em>is simply amazing, wow!</p></blockquote> <p>The feature is now pre-alpha only, but "it works". For more info please refer to <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/10/10/nhibernate-amp-static-proxies.aspx">Ayende's blog</a> or contact him.</p> <p>Happy PostSharping!</p> <p>-gael</p>
