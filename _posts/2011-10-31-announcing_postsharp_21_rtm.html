<p>I&rsquo;m delighted to announce the release of PostSharp 2.1 RTM, available for download on <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/downloads/postsharp-2.1/rtm/PostSharp-2.1.5.1.exe">our web site</a> and on <a href="http://www.nuget.org/List/Packages/PostSharp">NuGet</a>.</p>



<p>The last release candidate has been available as the front-page download for more than a month now with no reported bugs. PostSharp 2.1 becomes the recommended version for everyone and is now considered more stable than the 2.0 branch.</p>
<h2>New features</h2>
<p>PostSharp 2.1 brings the following improvements to PostSharp 2.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved build-time performance: up to 5x faster. <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/blog/2011/01/default.aspx">Read more.</a></li>
<li>Architecture validation: build-time validation of design rules. <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/blog/post/Architectural-Validation.aspx">Read more.</a></li>
<li>Extended reflection API: programmatically navigate code references. <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/blog/post/New-in-PostSharp-21-Reflecting-Custom-Attributes.aspx">Read more</a> <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/blog/post/New-in-PostSharp-21-Navigating-Code-Relationships.aspx">and more</a>. </li>

<li>Improved Visual Studio Extension (PostSharp tab page in project properties).</li>
<li>Warnings and errors now come with file/line information. The feature is optional and must be enabled manually from Visual Studio options. We&rsquo;re eager to hear feedback about this feature from customers with larger projects. </li>
<li>Support for Silverlight 5 and Windows Phone 7.1. </li>
<li>Compatibility with Code Contracts 4. </li>
<li>Improved messaging API. </li>
<li>Streamlined licensing experience and &ldquo;getting started&rdquo;.</li>
<li>License server (optional).</li>
<li>Streamlined &ldquo;getting started&rdquo; experience.</li>
<li>Warnings can be disabled locally (for a specific element of code) using the <strong>IgnoreWarning</strong> custom attribute. See <a href="http://doc.sharpcrafters.com/postsharp-2.1/Content.aspx/PostSharp-2.1.chm/html/dbcf53d8-7525-48c2-b5fc-0aea945c6957.htm">online documentation</a> for details. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<p>The RTM fixes the following issues from RC2:</p>
<ul>
<li>"EnhancedByPostSharpAttribute" causes issues with the WPF compiler</li>
<li>Aspected methods with parameter of generic types are not underlined in VS code editor</li>
<li>Constant SkipPostSharp does not work</li>
<li>Different versions of PostSharp cannot be used in the same solution</li>
<li>Error due to file lock of *.vhost.exe</li>
<li>Invalid version number is written in native resources</li>
<li>MSBuild error "CodeContractsPerformCodeAnalysis target is missing" with Code Contracts Standard (without Code Analysis)</li>
<li>Type parser throws exception with arrays or generic types</li>
</ul>
<h2>Upgrading from PostSharp 2.0</h2>
<p>This new version is fully backward compatible with PostSharp 2.0 (except one breaking bug fix), and can be installed side-by-side with PostSharp 2.0. In order to upgrade, you should just update the references to PostSharp.dll (and possibly to PostSharp.targets, if PostSharp is installed in source control). A utility contained in PostSharp HQ helps you converting projects from 2.0 to 2.1.</p>
<p><strong>The upgrade is free for everyone</strong> and your 2.0 license key will work with 2.1. However, you will be asked to enter your license key.</p>
<p>Even if you are happy with the features of 2.0, <strong>you have to upgrade to 2.1 because your projects are going to compile damn faster</strong>! Frankly. PostSharp has now the fastest MSIL engine on the market.</p>
<h2>Announcing PostSharp 2.0 Update 6</h2>
<p>By the way, we&rsquo;ve also updated the PostSharp 2.0 release. It contains the following fixes compared to the previous update. Needless to say, these fixes are also included in the 2.1 release.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aspect instance fields should not be marked as serializable</li>
<li>Aspects may conflict with themselves</li>
<li>Attempt to use two adornment layers when symbol file is updated</li>
<li>BaseMarkerManager.RefreshTextMarkers causes AccessViolationException</li>
<li>Collapsed region names should not be underlined by the VSX</li>
<li>CSharpLanguageAdapter.VisitPropertyAccessor causes CodeProperty.get_Parent to throw InvalidOperationException</li>

<li>Exception in MulticastAttributeTask with inheritance on generic methods</li>
<li>Exception when an aspect is applied to a generic protected method, or a protected method of a generic type, in a third assembly.</li>
<li>Exception when an aspect is applied to a virtual method of a sealed/value type</li>
<li>Exception with multicasting inheritance on generic methods.</li>
<li>ImportMember throws an exception when a member is a property and an accessor is missing.</li>
<li>In IntroduceMember, CopyCustomAttribute with merge does not work</li>
<li>Incompatibility of the PostSharp VSX with CodeRush - collapsed regions</li>
<li>Invalid code generation when several OnMethodBoundary aspects are applied</li>
<li>Invalid code generation with a MSIL-serialized aspect containing an array argument</li>
<li>Invalid handling of generic instances in reflection wrappers</li>

<li>MSBuild step "PostSharp20CopyOutputToCodeAnalysis" can fail because of file locking</li>

<li>WriteWeavingSymbolsTask.Execute throws UnauthorizedAccessException</li>
</ul>
<h2>What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
<p>It has been precisely one year since I started working on PostSharp 2.1. Arguably, it took way too much time to get that release out of the door. And here&rsquo;s why: most of our time was invested in building the company and spreading the work about AOP. Since July, I&rsquo;ve started research and planning for the next major version of PostSharp and a new product code-named Resonance, which will be to .NET software what magnetic resonance is to human body (detailed and non-invasive imaging). We&rsquo;ve hired two software developers and, while PostSharp 2.1 was maturing, we started real development on the new &ldquo;thing&rdquo;. You&rsquo;re going to be amazed, I promise.</p>
<p>But today, we&rsquo;ve become confident that PostSharp 2.1 is ready for production, and it&rsquo;s a great time for you to upgrade.</p>
<p>Happy PostSharping!</p>
