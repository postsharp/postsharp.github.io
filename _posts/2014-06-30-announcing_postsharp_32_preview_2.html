<p>We didn’t want to let the first half of this year go without reaching a new milestone, and here it is: we’re excited to announce <strong>PostSharp 3.2 Preview 2</strong>, available for download on <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/PostSharp/3.2.24-beta">NuGet</a> and <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/download">our website</a>. PostSharp 3.2 is now <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/download">fully documented</a> and has made it through the final API review. </p><p>We didn’t really know where we were heading to when we started to work on this version, but after a six-month journey we’re very happy of the result.</p><p>And here’s our proudest achievement:</p><p><strong>PostSharp 3.2 allows you to write thread-safe code in C#</strong>. I mean, really. No, we don’t magically make your old C# apps thread-safe, but PostSharp 3.2 both extends and restricts C# to define an execution model that is verifiably thread-safe (we call that <em>threading model</em>). It’s still the C# you know: we extend the language using custom attributes, and we enforce the model using build-time and run-time verifications. So, if you write your code against of one of threading models of PostSharp 3.2, and if you cover your code with reasonable single-threaded tests, you are much more likely to have thread-safe code. Unsafe code would trigger build-time errors or deterministic runtime exceptions instead of allowing for random data races. </p><p>We would really like to say that if you use PostSharp you’re 100% sure to have 100% thread-safe code, but this would be absurd. No real-life programming language can claim that. What we <em>do</em> claim is that if you use the custom attributes provided by PostSharp 3.2 instead of writing thread synchronization code manually, you will have a dramatic reliability increase and an equally dramatic cost decrease.</p><p>PostSharp 3.2 supports the following threading models: Actor, Immutable, Freezable, Synchronized, Reader-Writer Synchronized, Thread-Affine and (the anti-model) Thread-Unsafe. For more information, read <a href="http://doc.postsharp.net/threading-models">Working with Threading Models</a>.</p><p>Object-oriented programming is a great paradigm to build business and consumer applications and we really, really don’t like the blind push for functional programming these days here at PostSharp. There is a word to describe this social phenomena: <em>hype</em>. Fortunately, people in charge for 7-plus-digit projects don’t make their decisions&nbsp; based on fashions. Although OOP has been criticized for being unpredictable in multi-threaded scenarios, we’re proving that well-understood technologies such as aspect-oriented programming, static analysis and runtime program verification can be used bring thread safety to mainstream programming languages. We still see bright days for OOP.</p><p>Although threading models definitively what we’re the most excited about, PostSharp 3.2 brings much more:</p><ul><li><a href="http://doc.postsharp.net/aggregatable">Aggregatable</a> and <a href="http://doc.postsharp.net/disposable">Disposable</a> patterns implementing parent/child relationships;</li><li><a href="http://doc.postsharp.net/undoredo">Undo/redo</a> through the Recordable pattern</li><li>4 new features in PostSharp Aspect Framework: <a href="http://doc.postsharp.net/t_postsharp_aspects_advices_iadviceprovider">IAdviceProvider</a>, <a href="http://doc.postsharp.net/t_postsharp_aspects_advices_importlocationadviceinstance">ImportLocationAdviceInstance</a> (these features, combined together, allow to dynamically bind fields/properties of the target class into the aspect class), <a title="IAspectRepositoryService" href="http://doc.postsharp.net/t_postsharp_aspects_iaspectrepositoryservice">IAspectRepositoryService</a>, <a href="http://doc.postsharp.net/t_postsharp_aspects_advices_initializeaspectinstanceadvice">InitializeAspectInstanceAdvice</a>, <a href="http://doc.postsharp.net/t_postsharp_aspects_advices_oninstanceinitializedadvice">OnInstanceConstructedAdvice</a>. More blogging required about it.</li><li>Runtime performance optimization of INotifyPropertyChanged (4x faster).</li></ul><p>Happy PostSharping!</p><p>-gael</p>
