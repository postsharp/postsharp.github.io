<p>Tracing has long been the "Hello, world" sample of Aspect-Oriented 
Programming. PostSharp does not make exception: tracing is still the first 
aspect visible on the home page, and most of early PostSharp bloggers did 
demonstrate AOP on a tracing aspect.</p>



<p>Yet, as tracing is a fundamental part of any non-trivial application, some 
advanced tools are available to .NET developers. Two of them deserve a special 
attention since their vendor provides aspects that can be directly used with 
PostSharp: <a href="http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com/see/PostSharp.aspx">
Gibraltar</a> and
<a href="http://blog.gurock.com/postings/aspect-oriented-logging-for-net-with-postsharp-and-smartinspect/848/">
SmartInspect</a>.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t ask me to compare these toolkits: they are actually sharp competitors. 
Both have good web sites and a free trial, so I can only recommend you give them 
both a try! And both have identified PostSharp as a natural complement to their 
product (Gibraltar being the first).</p>
<h2>Gibraltar</h2>
<p>I have a special moral debt to Jay Cincotta, one of the guys behind 
Gibraltar, since he recorded an amazing webcast of using PostSharp and Gibraltar 
together. Jay, thank you very much for this video, I know how hard it is to 
produce!</p>

<p>With these aspects you can declaratively add Gibraltar logging to your 
programs by simply tagging whatever methods, classes or namespaces you wish. 
This lets you add powerful logging to your applications without the effort, 
complexity or clutter of writing procedural logging code.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>[GTrace]</b> logs entry and exit from tagged methods including 
appropriate message indentation.</li>
<li><b>[GTraceField]</b> logs every change in value of a tagged field.</li>
<li><b>[GException]</b> logs exceptions at the point they are raised. This 
is a handy safe guard to ensure that both handled and unhandled exceptions 
are logged by Gibraltar.</li>
<li><b>[GTimer]</b> lets you graph method execution time in Gibraltar 
providing invaluable information to identify bottlenecks and optimize 
performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>These aspects (not the toolkit itself) are open-source and are hosted on 
Google Code at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/postsharp-user-plugins/">
http://code.google.com/p/postsharp-user-plugins/</a>.</p>
<p>For more information, see
<a href="http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com/See/PostSharp.aspx">Using PostSharp 
with Gibraltar</a> on their web site.</p>
<h2>SmartInspect</h2>
<p>Following Gibraltar, SmartInspect provides similar aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[SiTrace]</strong> automatically generates two log messages for 
each method call: one for entering a method and one when a method exits. You 
can also log the passed method arguments (when entering a method) and the 
method result (when exiting a method), respectively.</li>
<li><strong>[SiException] </strong>records all exceptions occurring in 
methods enhanced by the aspect.</li>
<li><strong>[SiField]</strong> lets you automatically record any changes to 
values of object or class fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>The aspects can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://www.gurock.com/smartinspect/resources/">SmartInspect Resources &amp; Extras</a> 
(look for <em>SmartInspect PostSharp Adapter</em>).</p>
<p>For more information, see 
<a href="http://blog.gurock.com/postings/aspect-oriented-logging-for-net-with-postsharp-and-smartinspect/848/">Aspect-oriented logging for .NET with PostSharp and SmartInspect</a> 
on their web site.</p>
<h2>Support for Other Logging Frameworks</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in using PostSharp with Log4Net, remember to check out
<a href="http://www.postsharp.org/contributions/instrumentation/log4postsharp">
Log4PostSharp</a>, a project of Michal Dabrowski and Mark Kharitonov. Note that, 
contrarily to what&#39;s now offered by Gibraltar and SmartInspect, Log4PostSharp 
directly emits optimal instructions, resulting in much better runtime 
performance. This is not a feature of the logging framework but of the aspect 
implementation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there is also some aging project from Eclipse,
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/monitoring/resources/download/btm/index_4_4.html">
Build to Manage for .NET</a>, providing PostSharp aspects for the IBM Tivoli 
platform.</p>
<h2>PostSharp Emerged as the De-Facto Standard</h2>
<p>What&#39;s happening there is that PostSharp is emerging as the de-facto standard 
for aspect-oriented programming on Microsoft .NET, just like AspectJ is for 
Java.</p>
<p>PostSharp 2.0 has been designed for the multi-vendor scenario, so that 
multiple aspects shall merge robustly when applied on the same element of code, 
even if these aspects come from different vendors who don&#39;t know about each 
other.</p>
<p>This means that ISVs can confidently rely on PostSharp to deliver aspects to 
their own customers. Good to know: the upcoming price structure shall make it 
very affordable for small ISVs to redistribute PostSharp free of royalties -- 
while enabling their own customers to use all professional features of PostSharp 
2.0, including the IDE extension, in conjunction with their software.</p>
<p>Happy PostSharping!</p>
