<p>We have just doubled the amount of RAM available to the PostSharp server.</p>
<!--readmore-->

<p>Guess what is the server configuration? What do you think a Microsoft-centric open-source project runs on?</p>
<p>Well... a Linux/Debian virtual server (Xen) running Apache, Mono, phpbb, wordpress, mantis and htdig! Daily backup using rsync. Try to have the same feature for less than 35 EUR a month on Windows!</p>
