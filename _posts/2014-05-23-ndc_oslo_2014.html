<p><a href="http://ndcoslo.com/">NDC Oslo 2014</a> is almost there. As every year, software developers will converge to Oslo. If you haven&rsquo;t done it yet, watch David Appenborough&rsquo;s <a href="http://vimeo.com/75314975">fun documentary</a> about this surprising seasonal migration.</p>
<p>PostSharp will have a strong presence with three team members, one workshop and one presentation!</p>

<p>NDC is connected with a few &ldquo;firsts&rdquo; for us: NDC 2011 was the finish line of the first PostSharp road tour ever. And this year will be the very first time we&rsquo;ll have a booth! Well, this was quite an experience to get prepared to a conference of this size. We got new brochures, video loops and t-shirts, and you don&rsquo;t want to miss this opportunity to meet Gael and the PostSharp team:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.postsharp.net/blog/page/Advanced-PostSharp-From-the-Horses-Mouth">Pre-Conference Workshop</a> on Monday, June 2nd: a deep dive from the horse&rsquo;s mouth. Disclaimer: attendees may change the way they look at software development. It&rsquo;s still time to register for your workshops if you haven&rsquo;t done it yet.</li>
<li><a href="http://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/agenda">Taking Design Patterns to the Next Level</a> on Thursday, June 4th challenges popular dogmas about design patterns and shows how design pattern automation is possible today in .NET.<br />The presentation starts at 9:00AM in Room 5.</li>
<li>You can <strong>meet us at our booth</strong>! We&rsquo;d love to hear how we can improve what we&rsquo;re doing and you'll get a chance to win some nice PostSharp gifts!</li>
</ul>
<p>As every year, the 2014 <a href="http://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/speakers">speaker alignment</a> is awesome; we hope to see you there!</p>
