<p>What's in common with PostSharp, you may argue?</p><p>I&nbsp;contracted for Good Data a few months in their early days. It was a great opportunity to meet Roman Stanek and Zdenek Svoboda, two famous serial company creators (NetBeans, now Sun's IDE for Java, and Systinet, eventually acquired by HP). Observing how they run startup companies was very inspiring and gave me trust in launching my own company around PostSharp.</p><p>Thank you to Roman and Zdenek for being so inspiring, and good luck!</p><p>-gael</p>
