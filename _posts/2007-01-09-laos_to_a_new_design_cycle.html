<p>We had two important discussions today with Andre, <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/community/forums/laos/479123478">one about PostSharp Laos</a>, <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/community/forums/free-discussion/116469275">the other about the 'freeze' dates</a>.</p>
<!--readmore-->

<p>The discussion about PostSharp Laos, together with other doubts I have, suggests me to send PostSharp Laos in a new design cycle. I really need more feedback like the one of Andre today. I need to know what are the problems encountered in situation. These discussions may have on the design of PostSharp Laos, at least on the public interface.</p>
<p>My initial plan was to freeze all public interfaces with the Beta 1 release (which has been delayed because Wang saw <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/projects/postsharp/issue-tracker/19">an integration problem with VB.NET</a>). But it seems that some parts of the code are more mature than others, and PostSharp Laos seems to belong to the second group.</p>
<p>So that's what I decided:</p>
<p><ol><li>The public interface of all core components (excluding eventually Laos and the MSBuild integration) will be frozen after the Beta 1 release. So people that started to use these interfaces (I know there are) can sleep on both ears.</li><li>The specifications of PostSharp Laos will be frozen with Beta 2.</li></ol><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remember that I really need your feedback to close the specs.</span> The quality of the design depends also on your feedback!!
<p>BTW, I plan to open the public interface of the <span style="font-style: italic;">weaver</span> of PostSharp Laos, so it will be possible to implement new base custom attributes using the low-level APIes and using the infrastructure of Laos. This will be after Beta 1, however. I am still hesitating about the right moment to introduced the planned but missing features of PostSharp, principally:</p>
<p><ul><li>the state sharing and
<p></p></li><li>the possibility to add aspects programatically at compile-time (and not only declaratively using custom attributes), of course using solely <span style="font-style: italic;">System.Reflection</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">PostSharp.Laos</span> (no low-level API).
<p></p></li></ul>
<p>Good night to all people living in my time zone,</p>
<p>Gael</p>
