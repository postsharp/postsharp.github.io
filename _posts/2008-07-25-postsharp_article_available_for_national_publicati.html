<p>I have an article available for publication <strong>for national audiences only</strong>. This means that the article should either be translated into a local language (anything but English), either distributed to a closed community (subscribers only).</p>


  <p>If anyone is interested, please <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/contact.aspx">contact me</a>. And if you want your favorite magazine to publish something about PostSharp, forward them this page :-D.</p>  <p>-Gael</p>  <p>P.S. The article is great!</p>
